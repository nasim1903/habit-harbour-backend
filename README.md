# LAP 2 Portfolio Week Project
You will be working in small teams to create a habit tracker.

## Requirements
#### Your website should have the following functionality for users:
- Users should be able to login
- Users should be able to choose a habit they want to track (e.g water, exercise, 8 hours of sleep) and choose the frequency at which they want to track the habit
- Users should be able to track a habit and mark it as complete for the day
- Users should be able to see if they have completed a habit for the day and see their most recent completion streak

#### Your project should meet the following technical requirements:
- Data should be persisted in a database
- Minimum 60% test coverage with an aim of 80%
- Your codebase should primarily feature the technologies we have covered so far on the course

## Presentation
- Prepare a 10 minute presentation covering the following topics:
    - Purpose of App
    - Planning & Delivery
    - Technologies and Code
    - Challenges and Solutions
    - Significant Code / Code you are proud of (include snippets!)
    - Test Coverage
    - Future Features & What We've Learned 
    - Live Demonstration
- There will be a 5 minute opportunity for Q&A after each presentation

## Timeline
- Monday - Wednesday: Focus on functionality and features.
- Wednesday 6pm: Feature freeze.
This means that no new feature can be started. Existing features can be finished, refactored or fixed.
- Thursday: Designated for debugging, styling, extending test coverage.
- Friday: All code to be halted. Merge to master by midday and prepare for presentations. All teams will have small-group retro with an instructor during the day so make sure to manage your presentation prep time around this.
- Friday 3PM: Presentations

## Code of Conduct
